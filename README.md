CHAPTER–1 DESIGN OVERVIEW


1.1 INTRODUCTION
The ARM Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) is an open-standard, on-chip interconnect specification used for connecting and managing functional blocks within system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs. It provides a standardized framework for high-performance communications in 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers, signal processors, and complex peripheral devices. The AMBA specification is built around a Master-Slave protocol, enabling efficient communication and control between different components on the chip.

1.2 FEATURES OF THE APB
Low Power Consumption: APB uses very little power, making it perfect for battery-powered devices and simple applications.
Simple Protocol: It has an easy communication method, making it simple to connect to other devices.
Single-Transaction Interface: APB processes one task at a time, which simplifies control for basic devices.
Wide Compatibility: Since it's part of the AMBA system, APB works well in many ARM-based devices.
No Burst Transfers: APB focuses on single transfers instead of handling multiple tasks at once, keeping things straightforward.
Easier Implementation: Its simple design makes it easier to build and connect peripheral devices.
